# particlegenerators
This package provides multiple generators which can be used in particle transmission simulation.

Currently it contains:

  * generators for source geometry:
    * flat disk
    * filled orb
    * partially filled orb
    * cylinder
  * generators for directions:
    * isotropic (4pi body angle)
    * cone
